This is the central server used to control an experiment.

The general structure of the experiment control scheme is that one or
several graphical client programs provide the user(s) with the ability to
edit text-based descriptions of the experiment cycle (=: timing-file),
display the experiment in a graphical way and run the experiment on the
hardware all via a simple interface. The clients communicate with the server
(this program) that has the job of parsing the timing-files, and of staying
in connection with the different hardware devices located on remote
computers. Finally, there are different device programs, one for each kind
of hardware (camera, GPIB, digital IO, analog IO, DDS).

The server is the only program that reads/writes timing-files or auxiliary
files (waveforms) to the disc in order to provide easy collaboration across
multiple computers. Also, the server collects measurement results from the
devices and writes those to disk. This means that after a client has
initiated an experiment sequence, it can disconnect from the server and the
experiment continues running on its own, under the sole control of the
server.
