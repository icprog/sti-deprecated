	* Transitioned the project from being python-demo to the
	actual server program. In the process, moved most code to
	the "python"-subdirectory.

	* Now contains working skeleton of Parser class and
	timing module.

	* System seems to have few memory leaks. Only known leak
	is in Python core (loose 9kB per initialization /
	finalization).

	* System has working Doxygen documentation.
