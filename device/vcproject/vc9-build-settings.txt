######  Visual C++ 2008 Build Settings  ######


###  Project properties ###

First we need to configure the project to properly link with the STI_Device library and the OmniORB libraries.  Open the project's 'Propery Pages' dialog. (In the Solution Explorer, right click on project and select 'Properties'.)


(1)  Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories : 
	Add the path to the header files (*.h) for the STI_Device code. These should be located at sti/device/include.  Use a relative path if possible, especially if the project is part of the sti directory tree and may be compiled on other machines.


(2)  Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions :
	Use the following definitions:  WIN32;_DEBUG;_CONSOLE;__WIN32__;__x86__;_WIN32_WINNT=0x0400;__NT__;__OSVERSION__=4


(3)  Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies :
	Add the OmniORB libraries.  The names of these libraries depend on the current project configuration (Debug or Release) and compiler version.
	
*** For 'Debug' configuration:   odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib ws2_32.lib mswsock.lib omniORB412_rtd.lib omniDynamic412_rtd.lib omnithread33_rtd.lib

*** For 'Release' configuration:   odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib ws2_32.lib mswsock.lib omniORB412_rt.lib omniDynamic412_rt.lib omnithread33_rt.lib


(4)  Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies :
	Add the STI_Device library.  The library should be located at sti/device/lib/STI_Device.lib.  If possible, use a relative path to specify the location of the library.

*** If you have not yet downloaded OmniORB to your computer, you will have to do so before step (4).  Copy the zip file from \\Atomsrv1\ep\Code\omniORB.  Extract to the directory c:\omniORB-4.1.2\.  Add C:\omniORB-4.1.2\bin\x86_win32 to your Windows Path (found under System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> Path.  Note that paths are separated by semicolons WITH NO SPACES.  You then need to build the deviceLib project in the sti\device\vcproject.sln solution, which should generate the sti/device/lib/STI_Device.lib file.  However, this will require you to complete at least step (1) of the IDE Options below in order for the build of the library file to be successful.

###  IDE Options  ###

Next we have to tell VC++ where to look to find the OmniORB include files and library files.  These options are specific to your computer.  Open the options dialog box (Tools -> Options...).


(1)  Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories :  
	In the drop down menu 'Show directories for', choose 'Include files'.  Add an entry specifying the absolute path of the OmniORB include directory on this computer.  For example, c:\omniORB-4.1.2\include


(2)  Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories :  
	In the drop down menu 'Show directories for', choose 'Library files'.  Add an entry specifying the absolute path of the OmniORB libraries on this computer.  For example, c:\omniORB-4.1.2\lib\x86_win32
