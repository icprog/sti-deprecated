This is the client program that is used to control an experiment.

The general structure of the experiment control scheme is that one or
several graphical client programs (this program) provide the user(s) with
the ability to edit text-based descriptions of the experiment cycle (=:
timing-file), display the experiment in a graphical way and run the
experiment on the hardware all via a simple interface. The clients
communicate with the server that has the job of parsing the timing-files,
and of staying in connection with the different hardware devices located on
remote computers. Finally, there are different device programs, one for each
kind of hardware (camera, GPIB, digital IO, analog IO, DDS).

The client is the connection between the user and the machinery that does
all the work in the background. It cannot do much without connection to a
server. The client acts as a syntax-highlighting text editor, displays
tables generated by the server from the timing-files and provides the
interface to give basic commands to the hardware like start, stop, etc. The
client is not inherently needed during the run of an experimental sequence,
i.e. once the sequence has been started, the client can be disconnected and
the experiment continues to run.
